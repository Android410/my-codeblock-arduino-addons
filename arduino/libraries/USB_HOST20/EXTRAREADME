BTD.cpp, BTD.h, SPP.cpp, SPP.h, PS3BT.cpp, PS3BT.h, Wii.cpp, Wii.h, PS3USB.cpp, PS3USB.h, XBOXUSB.cpp, and XBOXUSB.h are developed by Kristian Lauszus

For more information regarding the PS3 protocol etc. visit my blog at: http://blog.tkjelectronics.dk/ or send me an email at kristianl at tkjelectronics dot dk.
You could also visit the official wiki: https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0/wiki/PS3-Information for information.

All three PS3 Controllers are supported (Dualshock 3-, Navigation-, and Motioncontroller). 
They communicate with the Arduino via Bluetooth or USB using the USB Host Shield from http://www.circuitsathome.com/

A special thanks go to the following people:
"Richard Ibbotson" who made this excellent guide: http://www.circuitsathome.com/mcu/ps3-and-wiimote-game-controllers-on-the-arduino-host-shield-part-1
- It inspired me to get starting and had a lot of good information for the USB communication
"Tomoyuki Tanaka" for releasing his code for the Arduino USB Host shield connected to the wiimote: http://www.circuitsathome.com/mcu/rc-car-controlled-by-wii-remote-on-arduino
- It helped me a lot to see the structure of the Bluetooth communication

Also I would like to thank all the people behind these sites about the Motion controller:
http://thp.io/2010/psmove/, http://www.copenhagengamecollective.org/unimove/,
https://github.com/thp/psmoveapi and http://code.google.com/p/moveonpc/

All the information regarding the Xbox 360 controller protocol are form these two sites:
http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/UsbInfo
http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/

To implement the RFCOMM protocol I used a bluetooth sniffing tool called PacketLogger developed by Apple. 
It enables me to see the bluetooth communication between my Mac and any device.

All the information about the Wii controllers are from these sites: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiimote, 
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiimote/Extension_Controllers, http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiimote/Extension_Controllers/Nunchuck,
and http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiimote/Extension_Controllers/Wii_Motion_Plus
The old library created by Tomoyuki Tanaka: https://github.com/moyuchin/WiiRemote_on_Arduino also helped a lot.

And at last I would like to thank Oleg from http://www.circuitsathome.com/ for making such an awesome shield!
